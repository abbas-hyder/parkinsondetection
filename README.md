# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses voice data to detect the presence of Parkinson's Disease using machine learning, specifically the XGBoost classifier. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains biomedical voice measurements from patients.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI ML Repository – Parkinson’s Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons)
- **Records**: 195
- **Features**: 24 biomedical voice measurements
- **Label**: `status` (0 = healthy, 1 = Parkinson's)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parkinsons_detection.git
cd parkinsons_detection
```

2. Download the dataset and place `parkinsons.data` inside the `data/` directory.

3. Run the pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## ✅ Output

The model will print the classification accuracy. Example:

```
Model Accuracy: 94.87%
```

---

## 🧠 Model Used

- **XGBoost Classifier**: A powerful, fast, and scalable implementation of gradient boosting.

---

## 📌 Notes

- The features are scaled using `MinMaxScaler` to improve model performance.
- You can easily switch classifiers by modifying `model.py`.
- For reproducibility, a fixed `random_state` is used in `train_test_split`.

---

## 🛠 Future Work

- Add hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)
- Implement cross-validation
- Add more evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit
